<h2 align="center">• A SCULPTURE AT WESTERN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY •</h2>
<h3 align="center">ABOUT THE ARTIST: STEVE WALCOTT TIBETTS</h3>

<p>Tibetts was born in 1943 and attended Western Washington University as an undergraduate student. He won a student competition with Scepter and it got purchased by the associated students’ group. He has also designed chandeliers for the Whatcom Museum of History and Art, and sculpted a piece called “Machinations in the mode of senility” made from welded steel for the Seattle Art Museum in 1967. There is not much information about him open for public, and sadly, he has been deceased for a while.</p>
<p>Scepter is a sculpture located in Red Square at Western Washington University, in front of Fraser Hall. It was created in 1966, out of scrap metal from old car parts from the 1950's. It was an unusual material for sculpting, but he made it work. It worked especially well at the time, because in the 60’s, junk art was rising in popularity. Junk art is where artists repurpose material to create new artwork, and his work hit the spot. He was environmentally conscious when he created this. Instead of using regular materials like cray, or non-scrap metals, he went out of his way to use the extra pieces that others didn’t see the use for. He was never appreciative of the creation of unnecessary waste and this upcycling work shows his care for the world. Additionally, he was inspired by the Spanish architect/designer, Antoni Gaudi for this piece. Gaudi was focused on embracing the natural beauty of the world and so became part of Tibbetts as well. At our current global climate, we can all learn from him to be environmentally conscious about our materials.</p>
